Unity Editor should be allowed through the Windows Defender Firewall. If it's not checked in the \"Allowed apps and features\" section, it's blocked. You need to change the settings and check it.\n\n2. Check the incoming rules. If Unity Editor is grayed out, it's blocked. You need to display the properties and allow it.\n\n3. In the Unity Editor, select 'Assets/Scenes/Transport' in the 'Project View' at the bottom left of the screen. If the course is displayed as in the image, it's successful. \n\n4. Click the play button in the Unity Editor. If successful, a robot will appear as shown in the image.\n\nThe technical perspective involves setting up the firewall and Unity Editor settings.

                "Reply": "Answer: The article provides a step-by-step guide on how to set up a sandbox robot for reinforcement learning using Mac, Unity, and Python. The first step is to clone the AI branch of the hakoniwa-base. The Python program for reinforcement learning is executed directly on the host, and the necessary tools are installed using the provided instructions. The installation is performed in the directory directly under hakoniwa-base. For Intel-based Macs, the installation is executed using a specific command, and for Arm-based Macs, a different command is used. During the installation, you will be asked for a password to place various tools in /usr/local/lib/hakoniwa and /usr/local/bin/hakoniwa. After that, clone the following repository in the same directory hierarchy as hakoniwa-base. If the course is displayed as shown below, the setup is successful. At this point, click the play button in the Unity editor. If successful, a robot will appear as shown below.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the guide provides specific commands and instructions for different Mac versions (Intel and Arm), which is practical for users with different systems. From a practical perspective, the guide is straightforward and easy to follow, making it suitable for users with different levels of technical expertise.\n\nPoint: 90",

                "Reply": "Answer: The implementation of reinforcement learning in this context involves using Unity, Python, and a sandbox environment to train a robot. The robot model used is the same as the ET Robocon competition robot, which is capable of carrying goods. The robot uses an ultrasonic sensor that returns values between 0 and 255. When the robot is on a line trace, the value is around 120. \n\nThe reinforcement learning process involves several components:\n1. Reward: The reward is calculated based on the measurements from the ultrasonic sensor.\n2. State: The observed state is returned.\n3. Action: The robot's motor operation is executed.\n4. Number of states and actions: The number of observed states and actions are returned.\n\nThe implementation architecture differs for Windows, Mac, and Linux versions. The learned program can be applied to the actual robot by converting it to a development language for the actual robot (such as C language), which ensures accuracy at the timing level.\n\nPoint: 85",

The robot must keep moving and not stay in the same place. It cannot stop (Rule2).\n3. The robot must not collide with obstacles (Rule3).\n4. The robot can obtain sensor values for obstacle distance from three directions (front, right, left) (Rule4).\n5. The robot has motors for movement. It can move forward and rotate as motor instructions (Rule6).\n6. The parameter value for moving forward ranges from 0.0 to 50.0. The larger the value, the faster the speed (Rule7).\n7. The parameter value for rotation ranges from -10.0 to 10.0. Positive values indicate clockwise rotation, and negative values indicate counterclockwise rotation (Rule8).\n8. If the robot is rotating, the motor instruction value for forward movement must be set to 0.0 (Rule9).\n9. If the motor instruction values for both forward movement and rotation are 0, the robot will stop, which is not allowed (Rule10).\n10. The robot must output only one data for motor instructions in the following format: { \"x\": (value of x according to Rule7), \"z\": (value of z according to Rule9)} (Rule11).\n\nPractical Perspective:\n1. The robot must avoid obstacles by rotating, not by stopping (Rule14).\n2. The distance to obstacles is input in the following format: d_f=<distance to an obstacle in the front direction>, d_r=<distance to an obstacle in the right direction>, d_l=<distance to an obstacle in the left direction> (Rule12).\n3. When input according to Rule12 is given, the robot must output according to Rule11, following Rules1 to Rule10 (Rule13).\n\nThe user operation involves providing the robot with the distance to obstacles in the three directions (front, right, left) and the robot will respond with the motor instructions for forward movement and rotation.\n\nPoint: 90\nThe answer is quite comprehensive and covers all the rules and constraints of the experiment, as well as the user operations. However, it could be improved by providing more practical examples or scenarios.",
