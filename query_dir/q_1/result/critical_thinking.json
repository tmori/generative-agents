    {
      "Term": "Hakoniwa_Simulator",
      "Reason": "Understanding the specifications of the Hakoniwa simulator, including the correct setup and settings, is important because the robot won't move if there are setup errors or if certain settings are not properly configured."
    },
    {
      "Term": "User_Interface",
      "Reason": "Knowledge of the user interface, specifically the Unity Interface of the Hakoniwa simulator, is necessary since settings related to the EnableEx Ctrl checkbox might affect the robot's movement."
    },
    {
      "Term": "Robotics",
      "Reason": "Understanding how the movements of robots can be controlled within the Hakoniwa environment is critical to troubleshoot issues related to the robot's inability to move."
    },
    {
      "Term": "Computer_Networking",
      "Reason": "Knowledge of computer networking is important because firewall settings can impact the performance of Unity Editor and in turn, might affect the robot's movement in the simulation."
    },
    {
      "Term": "Operating_Systems",
      "Reason": "Understanding the compatibility between the Hakoniwa simulator and the Windows operating system is important, as it impacts the operation of the simulator."
    },
    {
      "Term": "Reinforcement_Learning",
      "Reason": "Knowledge of reinforcement learning is necessary as it is used to train robots within the Unity environment, which influences robot movements based on the calculated rewards."
    },
    {
      "Term": "Python_Environment_Setup",
      "Reason": "Understanding how to setup the Python environment is crucial for running the Hakoniwa simulator on Windows."
    },
    {
      "Term": "System_Requirements",
      "Reason": "Knowledge of the system requirements for running the Hakoniwa simulator on Windows is crucial to ensure that the user's computer can support the simulation."
