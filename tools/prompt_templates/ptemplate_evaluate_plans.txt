In response to the question {MainQuestion}, we have developed two different plans.

Plan 1: {Result1}
Plan 2: {Result2}

Please evaluate the appropriateness of these plans in Japanese.

For each plan, please assess and score the following aspects, and provide a total score:

Achievement of Objectives (0-20 points): Evaluate to what extent the plan achieves its specific objectives, which are primarily derived from research requirements. The score will be based on the specificity and completeness of objective achievement.
Strategic Consistency (0-20 points): Assess whether the overall plan is based on a clear and consistent strategy. This score is based on the consistency, clarity, and depth of strategic thinking.
Detail (0-20 points): Assess how detailed the plan's strategic explanation is, and how concretely each part of the plan is designed. The score will be based on the level of detail and concreteness.
Anticipated Challenges (0-20 points): Evaluate whether the plan appropriately anticipates challenges and considers solutions for dealing with them. The score will be based on the depth of challenge anticipation and the appropriateness of proposed solutions.
Diversity (0-20 points): Reflect on how many different documents the plan investigates from various perspectives. This score is based on the diversity of documents and perspectives.

Let's think step by step.

Plan 1's Total Score: <Plan1 Point>

Plan 2's Total Score: <Plan2 Point>
